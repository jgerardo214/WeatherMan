WEATHER MAN 

This is my finaly Udacity project. It is a simple weather app that uses OpenWeather API and uses Core
Data to persist data locally to the device. This app will use OpenWeather to get the user's local 
weather conditions. Cities can be entered into the search box and that will return the city's current weather.
