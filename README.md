WEATHER MAN 

This is my finaly Udacity project. It is a simple weather app that uses OpenWeather API and uses Core
Data to persist data locally to the device. This app will use OpenWeather to get the user's local 
weather conditions. Cities can be saved under Saved Cities tab which will get local weather to said 
cities.
