WEATHER MAN 

This is my finaly Udacity project for the iOS Development course. It is a simple weather app that uses OpenWeather API and uses Core
Data to persist data locally to the device. This app will use OpenWeather to get the user's local 
weather conditions. Cities can be entered into the search box and that will return the city's current weather.



This app uses Core Data to persist information locally. There is a tab bar that contains two tabs. One being New City which will have the search button to search for cities. There is a save button which will save the city name and the temperature. The information will be displayed in the second tab Saved Cities. Here a table view will list the cities along with the temp saved. Swiping on a cell will give the user the ability to delete the entry if that is desired. 

The current version is working with Xcode Version 13.1 (13A1030d).
